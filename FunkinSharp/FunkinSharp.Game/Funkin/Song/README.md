sup everyone, if you are reading this, i want to let you know that THIS whole code was made thanks to someone that decompiled the 

0.3.0 Prototype Newgrounds Build JS code into Haxe and I tried my best to replicate the new chart format

Please note that once the real source code releases this will be updated aswell to bet up to date with chart formats and fix my code

FunkinSharp SHOULD support charts greater than 2.x, legacy support will come once I get the new chart format done

TODO: Instead of making classes turn them into structs since they are behaving like one almost

Sup everyone, its kind of late but the source code has been released!

With this I can rewrite the whole shi I cooked but for a good reason

But instead of saying rewrite, I only mean finishing it to fit the base game

Currently I only have SongEventData fully finished, next commits should finish the rest of the data

and maybe add support for the rest of chart formats (1.0 and Legacy)

Currently the engine supports the following versions:
- Metadata: 2.2.x (No metadata file uses an older version than this one, lowest was 2.2.0)
- Charts: 2.0.x (No chart uses an older version than this one, only Test uses another chart format)
